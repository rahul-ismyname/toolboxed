You have the skills, but you're not getting calls. The problem might be your resume layout. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) reject nearly 75% of resumes before a human ever sees them.

Here is how to fix it.

## 1. Using Fancy Columns & Graphics
Two-column layouts look nice, but simple parsers often read them straight across, jumbling your text.
**Fix:** Stick to a clean, single-column or simple structure that is machine-readable.

## 2. Missing Keywords
Recruiters search for specific skills (e.g., "React", "Project Management"). If they aren't on your resume, you don't exist.
**Fix:** Read the job description and mirror the terminology exactly.

## 3. Saving as JPG or Word
JPGs are unreadable text. Word docs can mess up formatting.
**Fix:** Always send a PDF.

## 4. Typos and Grammar
This is obvious, but fatal. "Attention to detail" listed next to a typo is an instant rejection.

## 5. Focusing on Duties, Not Results
Don't just say what you did. Say what you achieved.
*   *Bad:* "Managed the sales team."
*   *Good:* "Grew sales usage by 20% in Q3."
