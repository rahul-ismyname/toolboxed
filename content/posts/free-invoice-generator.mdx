As a freelancer, getting paid is the most important part of the job. But creating professional invoices can be a pain. Spreadsheets are messy, and paid software is expensive.

In this guide, we'll show you exactly what needs to be on your invoice and how to create one for free in seconds.

## What Must Be On Your Invoice?

To look professional and ensure you qualify for tax purposes, your invoice needs:
1.  **Your Details:** Name, Address, Tax ID.
2.  **Client Details:** Who are you billing?
3.  **Unique Invoice Number:** Essential for tracking (e.g., INV-001).
4.  **Date & Due Date:** When should you expect payment?
5.  **Line Items:** Clear breakdown of services.

## The Problem with Excel & Word

Many freelancers start with Excel templates. The problem?
-   Calculations break easily.
-   They look ugly on mobile.
-   Tax math gets complicated.
-   It's hard to convert to PDF without formatting issues.
